## Disclaimer

I am a knowledgeable information professional, but not a doctor or public health professional.  Do not rely on the following as medical advice.  Consult your doctor or health professional, and continue to follow guidelines and instructions from public health officials.

## Current status

In transition from epidemic to pandemic (although WHO does not want to call it a pandemic yet).

As COVID-19 becomes a pandemic, emphasis will switch from containment to mitigation.  That is, if we can't draw a circle around it, we will work to slow the diffusion of it in general populations.  Everybody should maintain good hygiene (the same things that prevent colds and flu from spreading).  We may need to start limiting the ways people gather in large numbers.

Don't freak out, all this means is that we'll have more heroic attempts to slow the virus as humans adapt and co-exist with this new disease, in the same way that we co-exist with other diseases like the common cold and flu.

Slowing down the spread of the disease is very important so that public health systems don't get overwhelmed with too many people sick all at once.  It's much better, even if the same number of people get sick, to stretch out those illnesses over six months, or a year, or more.

## Likely outcomes

Many people (possibly half the world) will end up getting COVID-19.  Many of those won't have symptoms, or will have mild symptoms.  Others will have something that's like the flu.  Some will get very sick.  Some will die.

COVID-19 may become endemic, which means it will be one of the things humans live with forever, and that "everybody" gets once in a while, like the common cold or flu.  Like the influenza viruses do already, the COVID-19 virus may mutate over time, so we may get new versions of the disease, and vaccines to help stop the spread, every year.

Vaccines for COVID-19 will be developed, but it may take a year or more before they're generally available.

## Slow the spread of the virus

The virus spreads through droplets in an infected person's nose and mouth entering another person's eyes, nose, or mouth.  So:

* cover your cough, cough into your elbow or a tissue, and dispose of the tissue
* sneeze into a tissue, dispose of the tissue, wash your hands
* if you might be infected, wear a mask to help keep you from coughing or sneezing on anybody, strongly consider staying away from other people, call your doctor
* if you're infected, stay away from other people

To keep from getting sick:

* wash your hands with soap and water, or if not available, use hand sanitizer
* don't touch your face or eyes
* stay away from sick people

Most viruses aren't transmitted through the fecal-oral route, but there's some concern that COVID-19 might be.  That would mean additional hygiene, which you should be doing anyway to prevent spreading or catching other diseases, which would include:

* wash your hands with soap and water after going to the bathroom, changing a diaper, etc.
* close toilet lids before flushing
* take care / good hygiene with water and raw food
* sanitize surfaces

Continue to follow public health advice about preventing the transmission of the COVID-19 virus as more information is available.

## Masks

Masks work two ways for COVID-19:

* If you're sick, mostly they catch stuff coming out of your nose and mouth, which helps keep other people from getting sick. A surgical mask kind of thing is fine for that, you don't need N95.
* If you're taking care of a sick person or people, an N95 mask will help keep the viruses out of your nose and mouth. You have to make sure the mask is seated well on your skin and doesn't leak. [Facial hair](https://www.google.com/search?q=cdc+facial+hair&tbm=isch) will disrupt the seal. If you're wearing a mask, you should also be covering your eyes with glasses or goggles or something, getting virus in your eye will get you sick, too. Also, you should wear disposable gloves and throw them away after use, wash/disinfect your hands, dispose of all the germy stuff carefully, etc. A mask will not magically protect you if you get virus on your hands and then rub your eye.

If you are not sick and you are not taking care of sick people, masks are currently not recommended. (We'll see if we get mask hysteria, and everyone will have to wear one outside to be politically correct.)

The official word, from <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html>:

> CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.
>
> Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).

## History and origin

From genetic analysis of the virus, it seems that the first people were likely infected in November or December 2019, and that there were multiple people infected, before the virus started getting passed from person to person.  The virus was isolated and identified at the end of 2019.  The virus is related to other viruses that live in bats, so it is likely the origin was in bats.  But some other animal or animals were likely involved in the transmission from bats to humans.  The RNA virus is around 30,000 bases in size. By comparison, human DNA is around 3,200,000,000 base pairs in size.

## Glossary

Epidemic: rapid spread of infectious disease to a large number of people in a given population within a short period of time ("epi" means "upon", "demic" means "of people").

Pandemic: epidemic that has spread to multiple continents or the whole world ("pan" means "all").

Endemic: said of a disease the has become part of the background of normal diseases everybody gets (like the common cold or flu) ("en" means "in" or "within").

SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2): the virus responsible for the COVID-19 disease. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2>

COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019): the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019>
